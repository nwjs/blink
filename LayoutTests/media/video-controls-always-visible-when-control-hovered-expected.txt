Test video element control visibility after click on control. After the click the mouse does not move, so the control is still hovered and it should remain visible.

This test only runs in DRT!

EXPECTED (video.paused == 'true') OK
EXPECTED (video.paused == 'false') OK
EXPECTED (getComputedStyle(controls).opacity == '1') OK

END OF TEST
